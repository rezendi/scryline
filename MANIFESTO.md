The Scryline Manifesto
----------------------

Our world has splintered into different realities. As 2020's pandemic and
election show, what we once thought of as "the news" has fragmented into a
bewildering kaleidoscope of traditional media articles, online upstarts,
scientific studies, legal filings, experts / pundits on Twitter, eyewitness
YouTube clips, hectoring YouTube lectures, Medium posts, Substack newsletters,
Reddit threads, and more.

"But surely the job of journalism is to make sense of all this!" you cry.
Yes, theoretically... but journalism as we know it suffers from a number
of flaws which make it unsuitable for this sort of synthesis:
* Journalists are often loath even to link to primary sources, much less
their competitors.
* Journalism (and journalistic systems) still have a "dead tree" attitude
towards what they publish: articles are individual, self-contained, and set
in stone but for corrections, rather than connected nodes in a network of
living (versioned) documents.
* The open-source concept of incorporating suggestions from strangers into
their articles after publication is unthinkable anathema.
* Aggregation and synthesis of others' articles is considered inferior, low-class work.
* Readers frequently discover individual articles, often on social media,
without knowing important background or context. Often there is no good single
source to link to for an overview of that context. This scattershot
dissemination contributes to the spread of mis- and disinformation.

Scryline is built on the precept that aggregation is not merely useful; in
today's fragmented media world, to provide real context and understanding, it
is essential. This makes tools which enable collaborative aggregation highly
desirable. People try to use Twitter threads, Wikipedia lists. Medium tags,
etc., but none are well designed for this purpose.

The most obvious and intuitive form of aggregation is an _annotated timeline_,
in which articles, papers, tweets, preprints, blog posts, etc., are arranged
in (mostly) chronological order, and annotated with brief commentary. Scryline
is a home for such timelines.

Today's readers pick and choose their news as if from a buffet. Those who subscribe
to alternate realities will not be brought back by the offer of a few random
morsels from the real world. They have to be shown that real news is a
self-consistent web of interlocking facts and evidence, whereas bad-faith "news"
is incoherent, self-contradictory, and draws no distinction between allegations,
insinuations, and evidence.

To do that, you need the very thing our media kaleidoscope now lacks:
_context_. Series of citations showing how real news grapples with real
evidence, and comes to a good-faith understanding over time, while the claims of
conspiracy theorists are senseless and/or deceptive. That kind of context is
what Scryline is meant to help provide.

Scryline is also built atop _self-hosted data_. Its timelines are stored as YAML, a
human-readable data-serialization format, in GitHub repos. A single common
public repository is used by default, but it is also possible to use personal
and/or private repos. As such, Scryline's data:
* is always accessible to its users/creators, even if Scryline itself were to perish
* is automatically available, with complete version histories, via GitHub's rich UI and API
* natively incorporates GitHub's collaborative "fork / pull-request / merge" paradigm
* and is easily transferable to other services such as GitLab.

The word "scry" means "_to use divination to discover hidden knowledge or future events_."
