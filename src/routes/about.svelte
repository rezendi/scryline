<h2>The Scryline Manifesto</h2>

<p>
Our world has splintered into different realities. As 2020's pandemic and
election show, what we once thought of as "the news" has fragmented into a
bewildering kaleidoscope of traditional media articles, online upstarts,
scientific studies, legal filings, experts / pundits on Twitter, eyewitness
YouTube clips, hectoring YouTube lectures, Medium posts, Substack newsletters,
Reddit threads, and more.
</p>

<p>
    "But surely the job of journalism is to make sense of all this for us!" you cry. Yes, theoretically... but
    journalism as we know it suffers from a number of flaws which make it unsuitable for this sort of synthesis:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Journalists are often loath even to link to primary sources, much less their competitors.</li>
    <li>Journalism (and journalistic systems) still have a "dead tree" attitude towards what they publish:
        articles are individual, self-contained, and set in stone but for corrections, rather than
        connected nodes in a network of living (versioned) documents.</li>
    <li>The open-source concept of incorporating suggestions from strangers after publication is unthinkable anathema.</li>
    <li>Aggregation and synthesis of others' articles is considered inferior, low-class work.</li>
    <li>Readers frequently discover individual articles, often on social media,
        without knowing important background or context. Often there is no good single
        source to link to for an overview of that context. This scattershot
        dissemination contributes to the spread of mis- and disinformation.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Scryline is built on the precept that aggregation is not merely useful; in
today's fragmented media world, to provide real context and understanding, it
is essential. This makes tools which enable collaborative aggregation highly
desirable. People try to use Twitter threads, Wikipedia lists, Reddit posts,
etc., but none are well designed for this purpose.
</p>

<p>
The most obvious and intuitive form of aggregation is an <i>annotated timeline</i>,
in which articles, papers, tweets, preprints, blog posts, etc., are arranged
in (mostly) chronological order, and annotated with brief commentary. Scryline
is a home for such timelines.
</p>

<p>
Today's readers pick and choose their news as if from a buffet. Those who
subscribe to alternate realities will not be brought back by the offer of
a few random morsels from the real world. To do that, you need the thing our
media kaleidoscope lacks: <i>context</i>. Citations showing how real news is a
self-consistent web of interlocking facts and evidence, whereas bad-faith
"news" draws no distinction between angry allegations, sly insinuations, and
actual evidence. That context is what Scryline is meant to help provide.
</p>

<p>
Scryline is also built atop <i>self-hosted data</i>. Its timelines are stored as
YAML, a human-readable data-serialization format, in GitHub repos. A single
common public repository is used by default, but it is also possible to use
personal and/or private repos. As such, Scryline's data:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>will always be accessible to its users/creators, even if Scryline itself were to perish</li>
    <li>is automatically available, with complete version histories, via GitHub's rich UI and API</li>
    <li>natively incorporates GitHub's collaborative "fork / pull-request / merge" paradigm</li>
    <li>is very easily transferable to other services such as GitLab.</li>
</ul>

<p>The word "scry" means "<em>to use divination to discover hidden knowledge or future events</em>."</p>
