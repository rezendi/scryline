The Scryline Manifesto
----------------------

Our world has splintered into different realities. As 2020's pandemic and
election show, what we once thought of as "the news" has splintered into a
bewildering kaleidoscope of traditional media articles, online upstarts,
scientific studies, legal filings, experts / pundits on Twitter, eyewitness
YouTube clips, Medium posts, Substack essays, Reddit threads, and more.

"But surely the job of journalism is to make sense of all this!" you cry.
Yes, theoretically... but journalism as we know it suffers from a number
of flaws which make it unsuitable for this sort of synthesis:
* Journalists are often loath to link even to primary sources, much less
their competitors.
* Journalism (and journalistic systems) still have a "dead tree" attitude
that articles are individual, self-contained, and once published, set in stone
but for corrections, rather than treating them as connected nodes in a network
of living (versioned) documents.
* The open-source concept of incorporating suggestions from strangers into
their articles after publication is unthinkable anathema.
* Aggregation and synthesis of others' articles is wrongly considered
inferior, low-class work.
* Readers frequently discover individual articles, often on social media,
without knowing important background or context. Often there is no good single
source to link to for an overview of that context. This scattershot
dissemination contributes to the spread of mis- and disinformation.

Scryline is built on the precept that aggregation is not merely useful; in
today's fragmented media world, to provide real context and understanding, it
is essential. This makes tools which enable collaborative aggregation highly
desirable. People already try to use Twitter threads, Wikipedia lists. Medium
tags, etc., for this purpose; but all are ill-suited to the task.

The most obvious and intuitive form of aggregation is an _annotated timeline_,
in which articles, papers, tweets, preprints, blog posts, etc., are arranged
in (mostly) chronological order, and annotated with brief commentary. Scryline
is a home for such timelines.

Scryline is also built atop _hosted data_. Its timelines are stored as YAML, a
human-readable data-serialization format, in GitHub repos. A single common
public repository is used by default, but it is also possible to use personal
and/or private repos. As such, Scryline's data is always accessible to its
users/creators, even if Scryline itself were to perish; is automatically
available, with complete version histories, via GitHub's rich UI and API; and
is easily transferable to other services such as GitLab.
