<h2>The Scryline Manifesto</h2>

<p>
Our world has splintered into different realities. As 2020's pandemic and
election show, what we once thought of as "the news" has fragmented into a
bewildering kaleidoscope of traditional media articles, online upstarts,
scientific studies, legal filings, experts / pundits on Twitter, eyewitness
YouTube clips, hectoring YouTube lectures, Medium posts, Substack essays,
Reddit threads, and more.

As a result, people now pick and choose their news as if from a buffet. Those
who subscribe to alternate realities will not be brought back by the offer of
a few random morsels from the real world. Rather, they have to be shown that
real news is a coherent, self-consistent web of interlocking facts, whereas
artificial "realities" are incoherent, self-contradictory, and draw no
distinction between allegations, insinuations, and evidence.

What can help is a series of links/citations showing how real news grapples
with and comes to an understanding of the available evidence, over time, or a
series showing the ongoing bad faith and erratic claims of alternative and/or
conspiracy theorists. But to do that, you need the very thing our media
kaleidoscope now lacks: <i>context</i>.
</p>

<p>
    "But surely the job of journalism is to make sense of all this for us!" you cry. Yes, theoretically... but
    journalism as we know it suffers from a number of flaws which make it unsuitable for this sort of synthesis:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Journalists are often loath even to link to primary sources, much less their competitors.</li>
    <li>Journalism (and journalistic systems) still have a "dead tree" attitude towards what they publish:
        articles are individual, self-contained, and set in stone but for corrections, rather than
        connected nodes in a network of living (versioned) documents.</li>
    <li>The open-source concept of incorporating suggestions from strangers after publication is unthinkable anathema.</li>
    <li>Aggregation and synthesis of others' articles is considered inferior, low-class work.</li>
    <li>Readers frequently discover individual articles, often on social media,
        without knowing important background or context. Often there is no good single
        source to link to for an overview of that context. This scattershot
        dissemination contributes to the spread of mis- and disinformation.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Scryline is built on the precept that aggregation is not merely useful; in
today's fragmented media world, to provide real context and understanding, it
is essential. This makes tools which enable collaborative aggregation highly
desirable. People already try to use Twitter threads, Wikipedia lists. Medium
tags, etc., for this purpose; but all are ill-suited to the task.
</p>

<p>
The most obvious and intuitive form of aggregation is an <i>annotated timeline</i>,
in which articles, papers, tweets, preprints, blog posts, etc., are arranged
in (mostly) chronological order, and annotated with brief commentary. Scryline
is a home for such timelines.
</p>

<p>
Today's readers pick and choose their news as if from a buffet. Those who subscribe
to alternate realities will not be brought back by the offer of a few random
morsels from the real world. Rather, they have to be shown that real news is a
self-consistent web of interlocking facts and evidence, whereas bad-faith news
is incoherent, self-contradictory, and draws no distinction between allegations,
insinuations, and evidence.
</p>

<p>
To do that, you need the very thing our media kaleidoscope now lacks:
<i>context</i>. A series of citations showing how real news grapples with
evidence, and comes to a good-faith understanding over time, and/or how the erratic
claims of conspiracy theorists are driven by bad faith. That kind of context is
what Scryline is meant to help provide.
</p>

<p>
Scryline is also built atop <i>hosted data</i>. Its timelines are stored as YAML, a
human-readable data-serialization format, in GitHub repos. A single common
public repository is used by default, but it is also possible to use personal
and/or private repos. As such, Scryline's data:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>will always be accessible to its users/creators, even if Scryline itself were to perish</li>
    <li>is automatically available, with complete version histories, via GitHub's rich UI and API</li>
    <li>natively incorporates GitHub's collaborative "fork / pull-request / merge" paradigm</li>
    <li>is very easily transferable to other services such as GitLab.</li>
</ul>

<p>The word "scry" means "<em>to use divination to discover hidden knowledge or future events</em>."</p>
